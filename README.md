### Rules of the Game

A set of rules and a basic description of what the game offers.

* The game is a simple AR game built for the Microsoft Hololens during our Round 2 in the BVW class.
* The prompt for the assignment was to build an experience for Naive guests without explicitly asking them to do things and using techniques like indirect control.
* Your main goal in the game was to assemble your virtual aquarium starting with decorations, moving on to fishes and then feeding these fish.
* All the items in the world were moving around in bubbles and you could interact with the bubbles by using the tapping gesture of the Hololens.
